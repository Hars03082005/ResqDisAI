## üö® The Problem

During natural disasters, **victims struggle to reach help** and **rescue teams waste precious time** manually scanning social media or verifying distress calls.

- üîç Fetches live help requests from **Twitter** (via API)
- üì© Accepts direct reports via **SMS**, **toll-free number**, and **in-app**
- üß† Uses **AI models** to score **urgency** based on keywords and sentiment
- üìç Detects user **location automatically** ‚Äî even offline
- üö® Dispatches nearby **volunteers, NGOs, or government teams**
- üìä Tracks victim rescue status in real time

‚ö†Ô∏è Due to hackathon time constraints, development and testing were done on **Replit** to enable faster iteration, integrated deployment, and real-time team collaboration. The stack remains fully portable to other production-grade platforms.
